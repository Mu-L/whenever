This folder contains code for benchmarking.

There are three benchmarking directories:

- ``comparison``: for comparing `whenever` with other datetime libraries.
- ``python``: for benchmarking the library "end-to-end" in Python.
- ``rust``: for benchmarking specific parts of the library in Rust.

Benchmarking as part of CI is currently incomplete and work-in-progress.
